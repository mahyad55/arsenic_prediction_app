This study applies machine learning to predict arsenic (As) levels in groundwater across U.S. subwatersheds.
SHAP analysis identified key factors influencing As contamination, including land cover, agriculture,
and atmospheric pollutants. The findings provide a data-driven approach for environmental management,
helping prioritize high-risk areas for monitoring and remediation.
